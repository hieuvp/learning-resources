## Continuous Integration

### Travis CI

If your code is open source and you're more concerned about the continuous integration of your builds, Travis CI is worth a try.

### CircleCI

If you're looking for a GitHub friendly tool with a wide community behind it, that can also run within a private cloud or your inside own data center, Circle CI is worth checking out.

### GitLab CI/CD

If you're using GitLab, it's almost a no-brainer to try the GitLab CI solution as part of the pack.
